  abstract = {Methods: We implemented a browsing exclusion experiment (n = 15 sites) along a gradient of moose browsing pressure to investigate how this factor influenced the early-successional trajectory of boreal forests following clear-cutting in eastern Canada. We used Principal Response Curve analyses to compare the trajectory of the plant communities depending on site-specific moose browsing pressure and analyzed the trajectory of individual species leveraging these curves. Results: Our results show that all browsing pressures lead to alterations in plant communities when compared to exclosures, but the effect was stronger under heavier browsing pressure. Under heavier browsing pressure, we observed a lower ground cover of balsam fir, an increased ground cover of raspberry, reaching more than 60\%, and a lower abundance of saplings for balsam fir, birches and rowan. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that forest response to browsing is a function of local browsing pressure and that moose mainly slowed forest succession toward a closed canopy. However, heavier browsing pressure, through reduced sapling abundance and the resulting increased cover of competitive raspberry, may delay forest succession and push the ecosystem toward an alternative successional trajectory. As heavy selective browsing can interact with anthropogenic disturbances to determine forest succession, we recommend strong integration of the forest and wildlife management sectors to promote sustainability.},

  abstract = {Large herbivores can shape young forest stands and determine the successional trajectory of forested ecosystems by selectively browsing palatable species at the sapling stage. Moose (Alces alces) is the dominant vertebrate herbivore in Fennoscandian boreal forests, and high population densities have raised concerns about potential negative effects on ecosystem functioning and properties including biological diversity and timber production. We used 31 herbivore exclosures in Norway to investigate how forests developed after clear-cutting with or without moose present. We tested how tree demography, abundances of understory plant functional groups, community composition, and plant diversity (including bryophytes) across multiple scales varied with moose exclusion. After seven years, the exclosures were dominated by deciduous trees, including many large rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) individuals, a functionally important keystone species. In contrast, the open plots subject to moose impacts (browsing, trampling, defecation) were dominated by economically important coniferous trees and there was next to no rowan recruitment to taller height classes. The biomass of large herbs and ferns was much greater inside exclosures. This study emphasizes the large immediate effect of moose on early successional boreal forest stands. Landscape-level alterations caused by reduced deciduous dominance, and a reduction in large flowering herbs is likely to lead to cascading effects on ecosystem functioning. The management of boreal production forests needs to account for the combined effects of silvicultural practices and ungulate herbivory to ensure ecosystem functioning, but this management goal may be jeopardized in our study regions due to drastically reduced abundance of keystone species.},
