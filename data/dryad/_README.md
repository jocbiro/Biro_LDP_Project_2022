##This folder would have houses the data downloaded from Dryad Digital Repository (https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061%2Fdryad.3xsj3txdp), but I could not get the rdryad package to work. This data will be used to examine how different levels of browse severity affect understory plant diversity, including herbaceous species and sapling species.
