<!-- To keep pre-registrations to a reasonable length for readers, we recommend answers fit within a single page .pdf document, roughly 3200 characters. Read more about this here: https://aspredicted.org/messages/why_limits.php -->

## Data collection

<!-- Have any data been collected for this study already? (Note: "Yes" is not an accepted answer.) -->

**Yes**, data has already been collected and is accessible from Dryad Digital Repository (<https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061%2Fdryad.3xsj3txdp>).

Data Citation: De Vriendt, Laurent; Lavoie, SÃ©bastien; Tremblay, Jean-Pierre; Brousseau, Maxime (2020), Effects of different moose browsing pressures on the succession of plant communities within the herbaceous and saplings layers of a boreal forest, Dryad, Dataset, <https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3xsj3txdp>

## Hypothesis

<!-- What's the main question being asked or hypothesis being tested in this study? -->

> How do different levels of browse severity affect understory plant diversity?
>
> > 1.  Herbaceous plant diversity will be higher with more browse due to reduced sapling competition.
> >
> > 2.  Sapling diversity will be lower with more browse due to high browsing mortality of preferred broadleaf forage species.
> >
> > 3.  \*\*Note these hypotheses are not supported by literature and were created only for this assignment.

## Dependent variable

<!-- Describe the key dependent variable(s) specifying how they will be measured. -->

> Number of herbaceous plant species and sapling species (understory plant diversity).

## Conditions

<!-- How many and which conditions will participants be assigned to? -->

> Understory plant communities will be exposed to different levels of browse severity, defined at the proportion of twigs browsed versus unbrowsed.

## Analyses

<!-- Specify exactly which analyses you will conduct to examine the main question/hypothesis. -->

> I will calculate browse severity by dividing the number of browsed twigs by the total number of twigs. I will use a scatterplot to investigate the total number of herbaceous plant species in each plot (response variable) by the browse severity value of that plot (predictor variable). I will repeat this for the sapling species data.

## Outliers and exclusions

<!-- Describe exactly how outliers will be defined and handled, and your precise rule(s) for excluding observations. -->

> I will not be identifying or excluding outliers.

## Sample size

<!-- How many observations will be collected or what will determine sample size? No need to justify decision, but be precise about _exactly_ how the number will be determined. -->

> Data has been collected at 15 paired sites (fenced and unfenced).

## Study type

-   Experiment
